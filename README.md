### Note:

In order to work on this file and knit it properly we well need to have LATEX downloaded on our computer!

To do so you can do this: Install TinyTeX - it is lightweight, works perfectly with R Markdown, and installs automatically from R.

Install it with one line in R:

```         
#install.packages("tinytex")
#tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

After installing: Restart RStudio → Knit again → Your document will compile.
